# Obstacle Avoidance

The objective of this practice is to implement the logic of the VFF navigation algorithm. Navigation using VFF (Virtual Force Field), consists of:

* Each object in the environment generates a repulsive force towards the robot.

* Destiny generates an attractive force in the robot.

This makes it possible for the robot to go towards the target, distancing itself of the obstacles, so that their address is the vector sum of all the forces.
