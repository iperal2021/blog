Welcome!

I'm Iker Peral del Pino, student of the degree of *Ingenieria en Robótica Software* at the [University Rey Juan Carlos](https://www.urjc.es/) 

This blog has the purpose of showing the progress made in each of the practices of the subject *Robótica Móvil*.

For all the practices of the subject I am using the web software [Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/) wich provides the tools to write the necesary code and to visualize the simulation of the robot.

Each post of the blog will contain the report of each practice and the procedure followed to obtain the results. These posts will have changes over time.
